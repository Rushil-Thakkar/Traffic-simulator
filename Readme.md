### Real time Traffic simulator (Java, Multithreading, Swing panels, Graphics)
- Crated Java based graphical projects in which I used an algorithmic logic of changing the lanes for the
vehicles to reduce the real-time traffic situation and collision by 10% in low visibility stations.
- Worked with different Java packages like AWT, graphics, swing and canvas to create the real effect of
actual traffic. Made the canvas of vehicles and road to have the exact image of the real time traffic.
